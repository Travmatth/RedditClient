"body": "The explanations in this thread are grossly simplified. To understand what happened in the Air France crash, you have to understand how the logic of the avionics works. TL;DR the avionics on Airbus aircraft prevent the aircraft from flying outside the flight envelope, essentially protecting it from stalls and overspends. However, when the avionics lose a vital piece of information(such as the airspeed due to the probes icing over) it no longer protects the aircraft from the previously mentioned conditions. In the primary law the recovery from a slow-speed condition\/stall is to apply max thrust and full back pressure on the control stick, since the aircraft will not let itself stall. The pilots did exactly this. Problem was, the airspeed probes got iced over. Aircraft was in secondary law and able to stall. Pilots never realized this, and their actions caused a perfectly airworthy aircraft to plunge 30,000ft into the ocean because of a maneuver that is taught to pilots within the first 10 hours of their training at the most basic levels. \n\nSide note, not a big fan of Airbus due to their whole control logic(and I'd like to think this accident demonstrates why it can be a problem), but that's a topic for another day.\n\nEdit: Never answered your question: Most aircraft(all that are used for commercial operations) have a backup attitude indicator. But they are gyro powered. Bubble levels simply would not work, nor would, say, a glass of water.

"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explanations in this thread are grossly simplified. To understand what happened in the Air France crash, you have to understand how the logic of the avionics works. TL;DR the avionics on Airbus aircraft prevent the aircraft from flying outside the flight envelope, essentially protecting it from stalls and overspends. However, when the avionics lose a vital piece of information(such as the airspeed due to the probes icing over) it no longer protects the aircraft from the previously mentioned conditions.

Once at night he had me close my eyes and turn my head to the right, then he put the plane into a series of simple maneuvers, such as banking, climbing and descending. Then he said, open your eyes and when you&amp;#39;re ready tell me &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got the airplane.&amp;quot; When I did,  I only saw stars overhead, and nothing else to convince me we were in anything other than straight and level flight. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In actuality, the plane was pointed due north with a slight bank to the left. I saw no lights on the ground. we were near the coast just inland of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All of the visible lighting in that area is on the coast. Both the ocean to the east and the Everglades to the left looked pitch black. I was looking outside the plane, not at the instruments, and my instructor knew that. After 30 or 45 seconds, we were headed almost due south.  That&amp;#39;s when I finally saw the lights of Miami, and the horizon at about a 15\u00b0 angle. he did that a few other times and other circumstances, the same goal: to convince me not to trust my eyes and my inner ear. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;",

So there are likely to be some sensory illusions. In particular it is difficult to differentiate between 'acceleration' and 'pitching up' and it is also difficult to differentiate between 'de-acceleration' and 'pitching down'.\n\nThe biological link is based on the fluid in the ears, which can sense acceleration but cannot sense 'speed' or 'pitch'. So expectations are added to the sensory data to make a 'best guess' or what is going on.\n\nThe pilot of course will be looking at the instruments to ensure that their 'expectations' are set correctly. If the instruments and senses contradict, the instruments will be trusted.\n",

So there are likely to be some sensory illusions. In particular it is difficult to differentiate between &amp;#39;acceleration&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;pitching up&amp;#39; and it is also difficult to differentiate between &amp;#39;de-acceleration&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;pitching down&amp;#39;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biological link is based on the fluid in the ears, which can sense acceleration but cannot sense &amp;#39;speed&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;pitch&amp;#39;. So expectations are added to the sensory data to make a &amp;#39;best guess&amp;#39; or what is going on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pilot of course will be looking at the instruments to ensure that their &amp;#39;expectations&amp;#39; are set correctly. If the instruments and senses contradict, the instruments will be trusted.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;",
