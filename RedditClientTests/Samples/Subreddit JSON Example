Basically I thought when you use a for I in file: it would make I = the number of the line its on instead of the string that is actually on that line. \n\n[This is my code.] (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fe3946897937cd866d76)\nMy issue is I have a txt file I'm reading numbers off of, and then adding them together and averaging them. But when I use eval (line 31) it causes an error, if I don't use eval then it doesn't work because it's not a number. Using float() also doesn't work, I'll post error codes below.\n\nEdit:Top error is from eval(), bottom is float():\n\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;\n        app = App()\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 3, in __init__\n        self.City()\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 9, in City\n        self.DataIn(File)\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 25, in DataIn\n        self.Average(Info)\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 31, in Average\n        Amount = Amount + eval(i)\n      File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 0\n        \n        ^\n    SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\n\n#\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;\n        app = App()\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 3, in __init__\n        self.City()\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 9, in City\n        self.DataIn(File)\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 25, in DataIn\n        self.Average(Info)\n      File \"F:\\CSC 110\\Assignment 4\\Vehicles.py\", line 31, in Average\n        Amount = Amount + float(i)\n    ValueError: could not convert string to float:   ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3ubdxe", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barry_the_UPS_guy", "media": null, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 25, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1448529610.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/3ubdxe/python_string_to_float/", "locked": false, "name": "t3_3ubdxe", "created": 1448547455.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3ubdxe/python_string_to_float/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "[Python] String to Float", "created_utc": 1448518655.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.learnprogramming", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I&amp;#39;m currently working on a homework assignment for a C class I&amp;#39;m taking.

I am, however, using a library the company wrote ~6 years ago, so maybe that has a memory leak and not my program?\n\nMy question, in addition to the title, to the more experienced people here is, if your program was running out of memory and aborting, but you didn't allocate any memory yourself, where would you first start looking?\n\nEDIT: Another note I just remember, looking through the library code I'm using, there *is* a malloc without a matching free(). If my google-fu is correct, then the responsibility to free the memory is passed back to the caller, which ultimately comes back to me.
