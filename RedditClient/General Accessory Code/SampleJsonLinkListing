Whether it\u2019s a shooter at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, a plane flying into a building in Texas, or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America has confronted many forms of violent extremism in our history.  Deranged or alienated individuals -- often U.S. citizens or legal residents -- can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent jihad.  And that pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at &lt;strong&gt;Fort Hood&lt;/strong&gt; and the bombing of the Boston Marathon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that\u2019s the current threat -- lethal yet less capable al Qaeda affiliates; threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad; homegrown extremists.  This is the future of &lt;strong&gt;terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emphasis mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cxn2rzp", "created": 1449276992.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1449248192.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 84}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 33, "parent_id": "t1_cxn0ge3", "id": "cxn0tkd", "name": "t1_cxn0tkd", "children": ["cxn0tkd", "cxn0wbz", "cxn1itl", "cxn2774", "cxn3t8k", "cxn5m1v"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxn0ge3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jeffhext", "parent_id": "t1_cxn0c7m", "score": 143, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "He called the Fort Hood attacks workplace violence", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called the Fort Hood attacks workplace violence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "news", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cxn0ge3", "created": 1449273541.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1449244741.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 143}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3vfaji", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "nz8xc1720oafdc9f57aa9b01294d229f307fbd6405e9c65a93", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3vfaji", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "nz8xc1720oafdc9f57aa9b01294d229f307fbd6405e9c65a93", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 44, "parent_id": "t1_cxn141d", "children": ["cxn1v39", "cxn295r", "cxn2a1y", "cxn2zh3", "cxn32gk", "cxn377v", "cxn4d7u", "cxn5jlm", "cxn61j2", "cxn6uyr"], "name": "t1_cxn1v39", "id": "cxn1v39"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxn141d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheKevinShow", "parent_id": "t1_cxn0pg0", "score": 108, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hell, the guy was already screaming about gun control before the shooting stopped.

That does not seem enough time to travel to his home 8-10 miles away, load up all of their implements of terror, drive back to the site, and commit the act. Southern CA traffic is the worst.  We also have to figure that authorities, through traffic cameras, cameras at the site, etc.know exactly this guys travels. We just haven&amp;#39;t heard it yet. When did the black SUV show up on site. Did the SUV show up just before the attacks, or was it already there? Was his wife already on site, and did they use the SUV, with it&amp;#39;s tinted windows, to change from party clothes to terror clothes? That is going to be key information. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the argument about Islam, we don&amp;#39;t know how it started, maybe the terrorist started it himself. This is a terrorist attack.
